### Project Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions. The project uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.<br>

### Features
Analyze credit card transaction data.<br>
Build a logistic regression model to classify transactions.<br>
Evaluate model performance with accuracy metrics.<br>
Implement techniques such as undersampling to handle class imbalance.<br>
### Technologies Used
Python: For data manipulation and model building.<br>
Pandas & NumPy: For data processing and analysis.<br>
Scikit-learn: For building the machine learning model (Logistic Regression).<br>
Streamlit: To create a web application for users to input transaction details and check if the transaction is fraudulent or not.<br>
### How to Run the Project
Clone the repository using git clone <repository-link>. <br>
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. <br>
Run the Streamlit app by executing the command streamlit run app.py. <br>
Input the transaction details to check for fraud detection.<br>
### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains credit card transactions, where each transaction is labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent. It includes features such as transaction amount, time, and other anonymized variables.<br>
